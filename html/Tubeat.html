		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p class="card-text">
			This is a music game with button controller. I made a button controller with Arduino. I used 1500 yen for each button. In total, more than 5000 yen I used actually. You can play this game with Twitter like function. This program is for P2. P2 is a university class name.  It was my first time to use micro controller. I didn't know how to connect buttons to Arduino for the first time, and it was very difficult for me.
