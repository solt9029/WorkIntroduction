		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p class="card-text">
			There is a simulator of Drum Master. Drum Master is a famous Japanese music game. Then, I made this program to help users make music score in Drum Master. This is a system that you can make tja file physically. All you have to do is to put magnets on this system. This system uses hole sensors to detect the position and side of magnets you put. I put this system in the university when high school students came to the university. Every high school student enjoyed this system.
